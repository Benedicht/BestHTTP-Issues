Welcome to the official issue tracking repository for the Best Unity3D plugin suite, now encompassing Best HTTP, Best Socket.IO, Best SignalR, Best Server-Sent Events and Best TLS Security. This platform is dedicated to addressing concerns, bugs, and feature requests related to these plugins.

## 📚 Documentation First

Before submitting a new issue, we strongly recommend reviewing the [documentation](https://bestdocshub.pages.dev/). 
This comprehensive guide might already have the answers to your questions.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please:

1. Ensure the issue hasn't been reported previously.
2. Set the plugin's log level to verbose by adding the following line somewhere in your startup code: `Best.HTTP.Shared.HTTPManager.Logger.Level = Best.HTTP.Shared.Logger.Loglevels.All;`. More about loggin in the plugin can be found in the documentation's [logging topic](https://bestdocshub.pages.dev/Shared/logging/).
3. Replicate your issue.
4. Attach the log file containing all the produced log entries to your report for a more in-depth diagnosis.

Providing as much detail as possible will expedite the troubleshooting process.
